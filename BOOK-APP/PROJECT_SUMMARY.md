## 🎨 Key Design Decisions

### Why React Native + Expo?
✅ Single codebase for iOS, Android, Web (85%+ code sharing)  
✅ Rich ecosystem for PDF rendering  
✅ Excellent Supabase support  
✅ Over-the-air updates via EAS  
✅ Faster development vs Flutter for web  

### Why Supabase?
✅ Postgres with full SQL power  
✅ Built-in auth, storage, realtime  
✅ Generous free tier (100GB bandwidth, 500MB DB)  
✅ Open source (can self-host if needed)  
✅ Row Level Security for multi-tenant  

### Why Yjs for Sync?
✅ CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)  
✅ Automatic merge of concurrent edits  
✅ Works offline, syncs when reconnected  
✅ Proven in collaborative apps (e.g., Notion)
